# Introduction

> A sorting algorithm is a function that takes a sequence of items and somehow constructs a permutation of them, such that they are ordered in some fashion.

First, the study will evaluate algorithms with by follow properties.

## Comparison-based

Is a type os sorting that is based on a single comparison operation, for example "less than".

## Stable

> Sort Key - is a value used to determine the ordering of items in a given collection. 

In a stable sorting algorithm, the type of items with a same sort keys preserve their position order after the colletion is sorted.

## Recursive

Recursive is a behaviour in which function calls itself. Usually, recursive algorithms work by splitting array into smallers subarrays, and then sorting this subarrays.

## In-place

An in-place sorting algorithm needs no extra data structure in running to sort. Some algorithms cannot be used in place, they usually not overwritten his input and creates a new structure in memory.

## Adaptive

A sorting algorithm is adaptive if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the input list.

## Online

A online sorting algorithm is one that can sort a stream of input, i.e., in the order that a single input of collection is fed to the algorithm, without having all inputs from the start of the algorithm.
