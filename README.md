# Introduction

> A sorting algorithm is a function that takes a sequence of items and constructs a permutation of them in a specific order or arrangement.

First of all, the study will evaluate algorithms with by following properties.

## Comparison-based

It is a type of sorting that is based on a single comparison operation, such as "less than."

## Stable

> A Sort Key is a value utilized to establish the order of items within a given collection.

In a stable sorting algorithm, items with the same sort keys maintain their position order after the collection is sorted.

## Recursive

Recursion is a behavior in which a function calls itself. Recursive algorithms typically operate by dividing an array into smaller subarrays and sorting them individually.

## In-place

An in-place sorting algorithm requires no additional data structure during its execution to perform the sorting. However, certain algorithms cannot be used in-place as they do not overwrite their input and instead create a new data structure in memory.

## Adaptive

A sorting algorithm is considered adaptive if it leverages the presence of already "sorted" elements in the input list to optimize its performance.

## Online

An online sorting algorithm is capable of sorting a continuous stream of input, meaning it can process individual elements as they are fed to the algorithm, without requiring all inputs to be available from the start of the algorithm.
